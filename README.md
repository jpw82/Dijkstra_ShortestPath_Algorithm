# Dijkstra_ShortestPath_Algorithm
Python Implementaiton 

Created for a class assignment as part of my Computation Optimization course at GWU in the MSBA program.  

The funciton dijkstra_shortest_path(graph, start, target) will provide the length of and directions of the shortest path from one point
node to another given a network of nodes with known edge weights.  

This function requires the use of the Python package networkX and source data file in .txt format.  The provided data source
are lat and long coordinates in the District of Columbia and can be used with the function.

All code for this function was written by Josh Winters
